## Think-Tank-Case-Study

### The case study revolves around 4 data sets consisting of:
#### **ORDERS :**
#### 1.) *Orders (Order_id, user_id, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order)*
#### 2.) *Order_Products (Order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order)*


#### **SEGEMNT & ITEAMS :**
#### 3.) *Departments (Department_id, Department)*
#### 4.) *Products (Product_id, department_id, product_name)*

#### -- **Below is a visual representation of the work flow on how the data sets are joined using primary key in Dataiku to fasten the preprocess stage in-order to increase efficiency*
