#### **SEGMENT & ITEAMS :**
#### 3.) *Departments (Department_id, Department)*
#### 4.) *Products (Product_id, department_id, product_name)*

#### -- **Below is a visual representation of the work flow on how the data sets are joined using primary key in Dataiku to fasten the preprocess stage in-order to increase efficiency**
